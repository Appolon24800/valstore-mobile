# valstore

A flutter app using Riots API's and an unofficial API to display your Valorant Shop

## Status

This project is in early development and will see a lot of changes in structure and
functionality, you can expect as well some change to the UI.

## Contribute

In case of styling I would be glad to get some styling tipps since I am relativly new
to UI Development and Flutter.

## Credits

Only because of the original VShop branch I managed to implement the Riot Auth, thank you
creators of VShop!
